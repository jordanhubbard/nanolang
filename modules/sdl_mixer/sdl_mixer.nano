# SDL_mixer - Audio Mixing Module for SDL
# This module provides FFI bindings for SDL_mixer, a UI engine extension for audio playback.
# SDL_mixer works natively on macOS, X11, Windows, and other platforms.

# === Initialization ===

# Initialize SDL_mixer with format flags
# Returns 0 on success
extern fn Mix_Init(flags: int) -> int

# Shutdown SDL_mixer
extern fn Mix_Quit() -> int

# Open audio device with specified parameters
# frequency: sample rate (e.g., 44100)
# format: audio format (use MIX_DEFAULT_FORMAT)
# channels: 1 = mono, 2 = stereo
# chunksize: buffer size (e.g., 2048)
extern fn Mix_OpenAudio(frequency: int, format: int, channels: int, chunksize: int) -> int

# Close audio device
extern fn Mix_CloseAudio() -> int

# === Format Flags ===

let MIX_INIT_MP3: int = 8
let MIX_INIT_OGG: int = 16
let MIX_INIT_MID: int = 32
let MIX_INIT_OPUS: int = 64

# === Audio Formats ===

# Default audio format (16-bit signed, system byte order)
let MIX_DEFAULT_FORMAT: int = 32784  # AUDIO_S16SYS

# === Channel Allocation ===

# Allocate number of mixing channels
# Returns number of channels allocated
extern fn Mix_AllocateChannels(numchans: int) -> int

# === Sound Effect Functions ===

# Load WAV file
# Returns Mix_Chunk handle (pointer as int) or 0 on failure
extern fn Mix_LoadWAV(file: string) -> int

# Free Mix_Chunk
extern fn Mix_FreeChunk(chunk: int) -> int

# Play sound effect on channel
# channel: -1 for first available channel
# chunk: sound chunk to play
# loops: 0 = play once, -1 = loop forever, N = play N+1 times
# Returns channel number or -1 on error
extern fn Mix_PlayChannel(channel: int, chunk: int, loops: int) -> int

# Play sound effect on channel for specified time
# ticks: maximum milliseconds to play (-1 = no limit)
extern fn Mix_PlayChannelTimed(channel: int, chunk: int, loops: int, ticks: int) -> int

# Fade in sound effect
# ms: milliseconds for fade in
extern fn Mix_FadeInChannel(channel: int, chunk: int, loops: int, ms: int) -> int

# Halt playing on channel
extern fn Mix_HaltChannel(channel: int) -> int

# Fade out channel
# ms: milliseconds for fade out
extern fn Mix_FadeOutChannel(channel: int, ms: int) -> int

# === Volume Control ===

# Set volume for channel
# channel: -1 = all channels
# volume: 0-128 (MIX_MAX_VOLUME)
# Returns previous volume
extern fn Mix_Volume(channel: int, volume: int) -> int

let MIX_MAX_VOLUME: int = 128

# Set volume for chunk
extern fn Mix_VolumeChunk(chunk: int, volume: int) -> int

# === Music Functions ===

# Load music file (supports MP3, OGG, FLAC, MOD, MIDI, etc.)
# Returns Mix_Music handle (pointer as int) or 0 on failure
extern fn Mix_LoadMUS(file: string) -> int

# Free Mix_Music
extern fn Mix_FreeMusic(music: int) -> int

# Play music
# loops: 0 = play once, -1 = loop forever, N = play N+1 times
# Returns 0 on success, -1 on error
extern fn Mix_PlayMusic(music: int, loops: int) -> int

# Fade in music
# ms: milliseconds for fade in
extern fn Mix_FadeInMusic(music: int, loops: int, ms: int) -> int

# Fade in music starting at position
# position: starting position (interpretation depends on music type)
extern fn Mix_FadeInMusicPos(music: int, loops: int, ms: int, position: float) -> int

# Halt music playback
extern fn Mix_HaltMusic() -> int

# Fade out music
# ms: milliseconds for fade out
extern fn Mix_FadeOutMusic(ms: int) -> int

# Rewind music to start
extern fn Mix_RewindMusic() -> int

# Pause music
extern fn Mix_PauseMusic() -> int

# Resume music
extern fn Mix_ResumeMusic() -> int

# Set music volume
# volume: 0-128 (MIX_MAX_VOLUME)
# Returns previous volume
extern fn Mix_VolumeMusic(volume: int) -> int

# === Status Queries ===

# Check if channel is playing
# Returns 1 if playing, 0 if not
extern fn Mix_Playing(channel: int) -> int

# Check if channel is paused
extern fn Mix_Paused(channel: int) -> int
