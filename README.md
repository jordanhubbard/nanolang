# nanolang

**Status**: 🚧 Alpha - Core compiler implemented, known bugs present

A minimal, LLM-friendly programming language designed for AI programming with strict, unambiguous syntax, mandatory shadow-tests, and a path to self-hosting via C transpilation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the compiler
make

# Compile a program
./nanoc examples/hello.nano -o hello

# Run it
./hello
```

## Philosophy

**nanolang** is built on five core principles:

1. **LLM-friendly**: Syntax optimized for large language model understanding and generation
2. **Minimal**: Small core with clear semantics - easy to learn, hard to misuse
3. **Unambiguous**: Every construct has exactly one meaning, no operator precedence surprises
4. **Self-hosting**: Designed to eventually compile itself via C transpilation
5. **Test-driven**: Mandatory shadow-tests ensure correctness at every level

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **Lexer**: Fully working
- ✅ **Parser**: 95% complete (for loops buggy)
- ✅ **Type Checker**: 90% complete
- ⚠️ **Shadow-Test Runner**: 85% complete (for loop segfault)
- ✅ **C Transpiler**: 90% complete
- ✅ **CLI Tool**: Basic features working

**Working Examples**: 10/18 (56%)
**Critical Bugs**: 1 (for loop segfault)

See [TEST_RESULTS.md](TEST_RESULTS.md) and [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for details.

## Quick Example

```nano
# Define a function with its shadow-test
fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return (+ a b)
}

# Shadow-test: automatically runs when function is defined
shadow add {
    assert (== (add 2 3) 5)
    assert (== (add 0 0) 0)
    assert (== (add -1 1) 0)
}

# Entry point
fn main() -> int {
    print (add 5 7)
    return 0
}
```

## Language Features

### 1. Explicit Everything

- No implicit conversions
- No operator precedence (prefix notation eliminates ambiguity)
- All types must be declared
- All functions must have return types

### 2. Shadow-Tests

Every function must have a corresponding `shadow` block that tests it. Shadow-tests:
- Run immediately after function definition during compilation
- Fail compilation if tests don't pass
- Are stripped from production builds
- Serve as executable documentation

### 3. Prefix Notation (S-expressions)

To eliminate precedence ambiguity, all operations use prefix notation:

```nano
# Instead of: a + b * c (ambiguous without memorizing precedence)
# Write: (+ a (* b c))

# Comparisons
(== x 5)
(> a b)
(<= x y)

# Boolean logic
(and (> x 0) (< x 10))
(or (== y 1) (== y 2))
(not flag)
```

### 4. Minimal Type System

```nano
# Built-in types
int      # Signed integer (64-bit)
float    # Floating point (64-bit)
bool     # Boolean (true/false)
string   # UTF-8 string
void     # No return value

# Type syntax is always: name: type
let x: int = 42
let name: string = "nano"
let flag: bool = true
```

### 5. Functions

```nano
# Function definition
fn function_name(param1: type1, param2: type2) -> return_type {
    # body
}

# Functions must:
# 1. Have explicit parameter types
# 2. Have explicit return type
# 3. Have a shadow-test block
# 4. Return a value (unless return type is void)

fn multiply(x: int, y: int) -> int {
    return (* x y)
}

shadow multiply {
    assert (== (multiply 2 3) 6)
    assert (== (multiply 0 5) 0)
    assert (== (multiply -2 3) -6)
}
```

### 6. Variables

```nano
# Immutable by default
let x: int = 10

# Mutable (requires 'mut' keyword)
let mut counter: int = 0
set counter (+ counter 1)
```

### 7. Control Flow

```nano
# If expression (always returns a value)
let result: int = if (> x 0) {
    42
} else {
    -1
}

# While loop
while (< i 10) {
    print i
    set i (+ i 1)
}

# For loop (sugar for while)
for i in (range 0 10) {
    print i
}
```

### 8. Built-in Functions

```nano
print       # Print to stdout
assert      # Runtime assertion (used in shadow-tests)
range       # Generate integer range
len         # Length of string/array
```

### 9. Operators (All Prefix)

```nano
# Arithmetic
(+ a b)     # Addition
(- a b)     # Subtraction
(* a b)     # Multiplication
(/ a b)     # Division
(% a b)     # Modulo

# Comparison
(== a b)    # Equal
(!= a b)    # Not equal
(< a b)     # Less than
(<= a b)    # Less or equal
(> a b)     # Greater than
(>= a b)    # Greater or equal

# Logical
(and a b)   # Logical AND
(or a b)    # Logical OR
(not a)     # Logical NOT
```

## Complete Example

```nano
# Calculate factorial with shadow-tests
fn factorial(n: int) -> int {
    if (<= n 1) {
        return 1
    } else {
        return (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
    }
}

shadow factorial {
    assert (== (factorial 0) 1)
    assert (== (factorial 1) 1)
    assert (== (factorial 5) 120)
    assert (== (factorial 10) 3628800)
}

# Check if number is prime
fn is_prime(n: int) -> bool {
    if (< n 2) {
        return false
    }
    let mut i: int = 2
    while (< i n) {
        if (== (% n i) 0) {
            return false
        }
        set i (+ i 1)
    }
    return true
}

shadow is_prime {
    assert (== (is_prime 2) true)
    assert (== (is_prime 3) true)
    assert (== (is_prime 4) false)
    assert (== (is_prime 17) true)
    assert (== (is_prime 1) false)
}

fn main() -> int {
    print "Factorial of 6:"
    print (factorial 6)
    
    print "Is 13 prime?"
    print (is_prime 13)
    
    return 0
}

shadow main {
    # Main doesn't need extensive tests,
    # but shadow blocks are still required
    assert (== (main) 0)
}
```

## Grammar (EBNF-like)

```
program        = { function | shadow_test }

function       = "fn" identifier "(" params ")" "->" type block

params         = [ param { "," param } ]
param          = identifier ":" type

shadow_test    = "shadow" identifier block

block          = "{" { statement } "}"

statement      = let_stmt
               | set_stmt
               | while_stmt
               | for_stmt
               | return_stmt
               | expr_stmt

let_stmt       = "let" ["mut"] identifier ":" type "=" expression
set_stmt       = "set" identifier expression
while_stmt     = "while" expression block
for_stmt       = "for" identifier "in" expression block
return_stmt    = "return" expression
expr_stmt      = expression

expression     = literal
               | identifier
               | if_expr
               | call_expr
               | prefix_op

if_expr        = "if" expression block "else" block
call_expr      = "(" operator_or_fn { expression } ")"
prefix_op      = "(" operator expression expression ")"

literal        = integer | float | string | bool
type           = "int" | "float" | "bool" | "string" | "void"
operator       = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%" 
               | "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
               | "and" | "or" | "not"
```

## Compilation Model

nanolang compiles to C for performance and portability:

1. **Parse**: Source → AST
2. **Validate**: Check types, shadow-tests, return paths
3. **Test**: Run shadow-tests during compilation
4. **Transpile**: AST → C code
5. **Compile**: C code → Native binary

### Why C Transpilation?

- **Portability**: C runs everywhere
- **Performance**: Native speed
- **Self-hosting**: Eventually, nanolang can compile itself
- **Interop**: Easy to call C libraries
- **Tooling**: Leverage mature C toolchains

## Design Rationale

### Why Prefix Notation?

Prefix notation eliminates operator precedence confusion:

```
# Infix (requires precedence knowledge):
a + b * c        # Is this (a + b) * c or a + (b * c)?
x == y && z      # Precedence of == vs &&?

# Prefix (crystal clear):
(+ a (* b c))    # Unambiguous
(and (== x y) z) # Clear nesting
```

### Why Shadow-Tests?

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Tests run during compilation
2. **Documentation**: Tests show expected behavior
3. **Confidence**: Code without tests doesn't compile
4. **LLM-friendly**: Forces LLMs to think about test cases

### Why Minimal?

A small language is:
- Easier to learn
- Easier to implement
- Easier for LLMs to generate correctly
- Easier to reason about
- Less prone to bugs

## Getting Started

### 1. Write a nanolang program

Create `hello.nano`:

```nano
fn greet(name: string) -> void {
    print "Hello, "
    print name
}

shadow greet {
    # For void functions, just verify they don't crash
    greet "World"
    greet "nanolang"
}

fn main() -> int {
    greet "World"
    return 0
}

shadow main {
    assert (== (main) 0)
}
```

### 2. Compile (future)

```bash
nanoc hello.nano -o hello
./hello
```

### 3. See it work

```
Hello, World
```

## Why "nanolang"?

Because it's nano-sized, designed for the modern (AI) age, and every good minimal language needs a memorable name!
