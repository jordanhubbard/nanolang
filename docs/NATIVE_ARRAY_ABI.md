# My native array boundary

I currently use native array ABI version 1. `DynArray` still has a one-byte
element width; I reject records larger than 255 bytes. This change does not
remove that limit.

An array-bearing C export declares its compiled layout version beside its
definition:

```c
#include "runtime/dyn_array.h"
DynArray *example(void) { /* implementation */ }
NANO_EXPORT_ARRAY_ABI(example);
```

For NanoVM artifact imports with array parameters or results, I resolve
`example__nano_array_abi` through the selected artifact handle. I require the
declaration and function to belong to the same loaded image, and the declared
version to equal my runtime version. An absent declaration means legacy
version 1; it will not inherit version 2 when my layout changes. I reject a
mismatch before foreign execution and cache the failed call descriptor.

This is a trusted declaration by C code, not proof of its memory safety,
signature correctness, pointer provenance or ownership. Native-linked calls
and legacy logical imports do not yet enforce this check. I must cover those
boundaries before widening the layout.

`make test-array-abi-loader` checks matching and mismatched declarations,
unmarked legacy artifacts under versions 1 and 2, missing modules, and a
declaration supplied by another dependency. `make test-vm-ffi` also checks
actual VM dispatch: matching and legacy array results succeed; an incompatible
function whose body aborts is rejected without entering it.
