Look for large commented-out sections\n6. Review git history for disabled features\n7. Check for 'once X is implemented' comments\n\nTasks:\n1. Run systematic grep searches for TODO/FIXME/HACK patterns\n2. Review each identified location for relevance\n3. Determine if the limitation still exists or has been resolved\n4. Update code to use current features where applicable\n5. Remove obsolete comments and workarounds\n6. Enable any tests that were disabled\n7. Update documentation strings to reflect current state\n8.
