# C Samples

For more complex examples, like the first checkers game, I first had the LLM write them in C and then machine-convert to nanolang. This exposed all of the initial weaknesses of the language, led me to add more features, and then I was able to tell the LLM to reach feature parity with the example in this directory.

This directory remains in place and is reserved purely for future such "stone-stepping" examples.
