KNOWN DIVERGENCE: Division by zero
- Coq big-step evaluator (eval_fn): returns None (no evaluation rule for div-by-zero)
- VM (small-step semantics): returns 0 (total division, proved in Progress.v)
- Both behaviors are correct for their respective semantic models
- The VM follows the small-step "total division" design choice (Coq S_Div rule)
