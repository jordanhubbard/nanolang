# Chapter 13: Text Processing

**Powerful tools for working with text: regular expressions, structured logging, and efficient string building.**

This chapter covers three essential text processing modules:

- **regex** - Pattern matching with regular expressions
- **log** - Structured logging with multiple levels and categories
- **StringBuilder** - Efficient string building for performance-critical code

## When to Use These Modules

**Use regex when:**
- Validating input (emails, phone numbers, etc.)
- Searching for patterns in text
- Extracting structured data
- Text transformation with patterns

**Use log when:**
- Debugging complex programs
- Tracking application behavior
- Recording events with context
- Production monitoring

**Use StringBuilder when:**
- Building large strings incrementally
- Performance-critical string operations
- Concatenating many strings in loops
- Generating output programmatically

## Quick Start

Each module section below includes:
- Installation instructions
- Basic usage examples
- Complete API reference with examples
