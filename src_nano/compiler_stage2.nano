# Stage 2: Full Nanolang Compiler
# This file contains the complete compiler written in nanolang
# It will be compiled by the C compiler (Stage 0) to create Stage 2 compiler

# TODO: This is a placeholder structure
# We'll build this incrementally:
# 1. Start with lexer (already done in lexer_main.nano)
# 2. Add parser
# 3. Add type checker
# 4. Add transpiler
# 5. Add main driver

# For now, this file imports/uses lexer_main.nano
# In a real implementation, we'd have a module system or combine everything
